        Because it is, by nature, so complicated, this page will eventually show a flowchart describing how merchandise shipping works    
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>Allow time for backorder process. Receive/stock shelves, etc</li>
        <li>Flat shipping applies to continental us only. Foreigners will be offered worldwide rates</li>
        <li>Ship separately can have mult of the same item - sometimes it may be coming from a diff location</li>
        <li>Group my orders cannot override ship separately</li>
        <li>Add extra weight to flat ship orders if they are in oversize/non-standard packaging</li>
    </ul>

        //presuppose shipping days are mon, wed and fri
